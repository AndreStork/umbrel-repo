# AndreStork's Umbrel Community App Store

This is an Umbrel Community App Store that I made to easily install some services that aren't available on the official store.  
To add the Community Store you just need to open the App Store from the Umbrel Web Page's Dock, click on the three dots, select "Community App Store", paste the repository URL `https://github.com/AndreStork/umbrel-repo` on the textbox, press "Add" and enjoy.

## List of services
